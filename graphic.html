						<h1>Graphic Design Work</h1>
						<p>These pieces are all posters I made for different projects and classes. The Miles Davis poster is one of my favorites because of the bold colors and funky shapes against the contrast of him playing the saxophone. I chose to create this piece because I played jazz piano for 10 years. Miles Davis was one of my favorite artists since I played a lot of his music and learned to improvise like him. The original photo is more serious in the black and white coloration but you can see his passion for his music showing through and I wanted to bring that to life in this poster. A challenge with this piece was getting the photo imagery, vector shapes, and type to form a cohesive piece. I think I achieved this using bold colors and forms to visually represent the music. I also incorporated the sheet music to "So What" in the shapes.</p>
