						<h1>Sustainable Project Work</h1>
							<h3>Chia Bites Product Design</h3>
								<p>This project was a product and marketing project. I designed a logo and graphic standard for my product and created the product itself. A challenge with this project was that the product packaging could not be a standard box shape and that we had to completely re-brand a product or create our own. To get around these constraints I chose to create my own product, Chia Bites. I created my packaging out of muslin fabric and the entire packaging was 100% compostable.</p>

						<h3>Upcycled Aluminum Can String Lights</h3>
							<p>This project was an upcycling project. A challenge with this project was that all the materials had to be found items to promote reusing and upcycing of objects. I created aluminum light covers out of beer cans, a tack, wire, string, and spray paint that I had. I created a guide so that other people could replicate my project. The covers could be made with any aluminum materal, atached any way to the string lights, and painted whatever color desired.</p>
